        </p>
        <h3>
            4. INVOICING AND PAYMENT.
        </h3>
        <p>Traffix Marketing online SCP will start invoicing the Client from the date of commencement of the Services.
            The invoices submitted to the Customer will contain properly differentiated price concepts that are priced
            for the Services and facilities provided. Traffix Marketing online SCP shall make the invoices available to

            will accrue interest for late payment and compensation for collection costs under the terms provided in Law
            15/2010 of July 5, 2010, amending Law 3/2004 of December 29, 2004, which establishes measures to combat late
            payment in commercial transactions, without prejudice to the consequences that may arise from
            non-compliance, which may involve, including, the suspension or cancellation of the Service, prior

        <h3> 5. SECURITY DEPOSITS.</h3>
        <p>Traffix Marketing online SCP may require the constitution of security deposits at the time of contracting the

        <h3>6. OBLIGATIONS OF Traffix Marketing online SCP.</h3>
        <p>Within the framework of the present contract, Traffix Marketing online SCP is obliged to:</p>

            <li>
                To use its best efforts to ensure that the contracted services work optimally throughout the year and 24
                hours a day, unless for any technical reason the service should be suspended for any maintenance or
                improvement of the software or its equipment. In such cases, Traffix Marketing online SCP will try to
                notify the customer of the interruption of the service as far in advance as possible. Traffix Marketing
                online SCP will not be responsible for any service interruptions due to causes not directly attributable
                to Traffix Marketing online SCP, and that are related to problems with the information transport line or
                that in general are beyond the control of Traffix Marketing online SCP. The customer expressly
                acknowledges and accepts this disclaimer of liability of Traffix Marketing online SCP for such causes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Traffix Marketing online SCP guarantees that all information submitted will be stored in different
                equipment, so that, reasonably, under no circumstances can be deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Traffix Marketing online SCP also guarantees that the procedure of sending the information involves that
                it is encrypted at the exit of the customer's computer and that only the customer will have the
                personalized encryption key to access the information. Neither Traffix Marketing online SCP nor any
                other person, apart from the client, will have the encryption key, once it has been personalized by the
                client. Traffix Marketing online SCP strongly recommends customizing the encryption key. On the other
                hand, the customer will be solely responsible for the impossibility of recovering the information if the
                key is lost, and for any damages that may follow in the event that a third party makes use of the access
                key.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>7. OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CLIENT - CONSEQUENCES IN THE EVENT OF NON-COMPLIANCE -

                contract, and, in addition:
            </li>

                The customer is solely responsible for the information transmitted, as well as that the transmission
                complies with the rules of good computer practice, so as not to harm the rights of other customers or
                the equipment of Traffix Marketing online SCP. Neither Traffix Marketing online SCP, nor any of its
                representatives or employees, will be responsible for any infringement that the customer may commit in
                the use of the service.
            </li>
            <li>

                avoid errors in the service due to "quota exceeded". Traffix Marketing online SCP will in no case be
                responsible for the incidences caused by this error.
            </li>
            <li>
                In any case, the Customer shall be liable to Traffix Marketing online SCP and to third parties for the
                actions performed by the Users of the store as long as it has not been proven who is ultimately
                responsible for them. Traffix Marketing online SCP may limit at any time the maximum number of Users who
                can access the same Customer Content or the Customer's storage Service.
            </li>
            <li>
                Independently of the other actions that may correspond to it, Traffix Marketing online SCP may
                unilaterally suspend the provision of the service, in any case of breach by the customer of the
                obligations resulting from this contract. Upon prior notice by Traffix Marketing online SCP, if the
                customer's breach persists for a period of 15 days, it may terminate the contract. In such an event
                Traffix Marketing online SCP shall be entitled to receive any amounts owed, without whose collection
                shall not be obliged to provide the stored information, which will be deleted after 15 calendar days
                from the date on which the contract is terminated. 7.3.- Correct use of the Service The Client
